Dora - Dora loves to explore and always moving around. She is the most vocal of the whole lot. Bibi -Bibi was a stray kitten found in my neighbour's garden. He was just a couple of days old as his eyes were still closed. I brought Bibi to Goatee and luckily Goatee took to him. She adopted him and treated him as her own. Good Goatee!

I will be spaying her next week. I really need to find a home for Goatee urgently because my Ginger (out/indoor cat) seldom comes back to the house and I am afraid I will loose her as Goatee dominates the car porch area which is the gateway for Ginger to move in/out of the house.

She was very skinny and seemed lost. I wanted to send her to the vet to be spayed but unfortunately, she was already pregnant. She is currently at the vet and will be there until she gives birth. I will bear all the charges for her medical fees and whatever cost at the vet. I also plan to vaccinate and have her neutered when the time is right. I hope to find a good home for her and her future pups. Vet said she cannot be spayed until at least 1 month after she gives birth. Lucy is very good natured, friendly, affectionate and smart. She loves people. She understands ""sit"" after a few attempts and without much training. I believe she has lots of potential and will be a very good companion dog. Please contact me directly or contact me via email, if you wish to adopt her or any of her future pups. I sincerely believe she deserves a chance and a loving home. Thanks. If you are planning to adopt any mixed breed (local breed) dogs. Please, please, please be a responsible dog owner and neuter or spay them as soon as they are old enough to undergo the procedure when they are 4 months or older. There are too many unwanted strays and puppies out there and most do not get a chance in life and are put down. Local dogs are also very resilient and intelligent and they will guard your house well. But please do not chain or cage them unnecessary for a long periods of time as all dogs need to be able to move around and have their exercise. If you love them, they will love you back even more. UPDATE 10 May : Lucy has just given birth to 7 puppies 2 days ago. They are all up for adoption. She has 6 brown/tan cute puppies (like the color of their mommy) and 1 adorable white (female) one. There are 5 female puppies and 2 male puppies in total. Vet said she can offer a special price for spaying/neutering if you are willing to bring the puppy back to her clinic for the procedure. If you are hesitant to adopt a female puppy or unsure about the cost of spaying, please feel free to contact me and we can discuss or work something out together. Please do not hesitate to inquire if you need more information. You can ""book"" the puppies now if you are really interested. They can be adopted once they are weaned from their mommy at about 6-8 weeks. These puppies need a loving and caring home. If you would like to adopt a loving pet into your home, please consider these puppies. Thanks! UPDATE 15 May : Vet said Lucy is taking care of her puppies very well. She is a very good mommy. On closer oservation, there are 2 dark coffee colored puppies, 2 latte puppies, 2 tan puppies (like their mommy) and 1 white puppy. The tiniest puppy of the lot (tan) is also a female. UPDATE 26 MAY : Puppies are about 18 days old now and their eyes are opened already :) Very cute and chubby! One sad news, vet called today to inform me that the tiniest one has passed away. She did not make it because she was wounded unintentionally by one of her siblings, too weak and didn't really want to nurse. My heart aches to know this but at least the consolation is that she did not suffer much and has now joined other beloved pets at 'rainbow bridge'. Farewell little miss tiny. UPDATE 31 MAY : Lucy and her puppies are still at the vet's clinic. Lucy is not trained but I believe she is smart enough and has a lot of potential. Some people have asked what kind of ""mixed breed"" Lucy and her pups are. Lucy is actually a local dog (the common kind) and her size is slightly smaller than a medium framed dog. Since I am unsure about the pups' father, I would assume it was another local dog as well. If you would like more information, please contact me directly.

For several months now, my wife and I are looking after this lovely male dog which is “residing” at the beach volleyball field behind the hockey stadium in Bukit Jalil. When we first met Black, he was doing fine. He was looked after by the security guard at the place and Black in return did some occasional work by assisting the guard in his duties. For some undisclosed reason however, someone decided to turn the quite and nice area into a new to build car park. From that time, Black is in trouble. They took away his shelter and subsequently they terminated the services of the security guard, leaving Black with no place to stay and nobody to look after him. Several times per week my wife and I are feeding him, bathing him and see that he is alright but we noticed that the place becomes more and more invaded by more stray dogs who are chasing and harassing Black. The reason for this is that Black is used to humans and therefore in some way social and friendly, giving other dogs the chance to dominate him. At the moment he is under the professional care of Dr. See and his team in Sri Petaling for a severe infected wound at his back. Black don’t deserves this! If you have any idea or solution, please contact me on my mobile phone Hope for the best.Norbert Mohnen",87db66a72,1.0,5.5,5.5,0.0,0.0,4.9,4.9,0.7,0.7,0.9288594833333333,0.9288594833333333,0.09237814109999999,0.09237814109999999,0.09791016033000001,0.09791016033000001,0.79999995,0.79999995,1.0,1.0,dog dog breed dog like mammal,Black dog friends wife security guard car park See beach volleyball field hockey stadium security guard place guard place reason shelter Norbert Mohnen times trouble services duties work return someone nobody Bukit Jalil dogs Black way chance team care area wound back solution mobile phone idea reason Sri Petaling place dogs humans Hope,1,Mixed Breed,1.0,Mixed Breed

She was bullied by the larger cats around the area too which is why we took her in. We would love to keep her but our kitten doesn't like her very much. We feel she really deserves a good home with a loving family to look after her. She is heartbreakingly adorable. Conditions for adoption: 1. Kittens to be spayed/neutered when they are 5-6 months. Those who are interested to adopt the kittens MUST commit to spaying or neutering them when they reach minimum age because this is the only way to control our stray cat population. 2. Ensure regular vaccinations as per your vet's advise, and medical attention when necessary. 3. To be willing to provide regular updates on their progress until they are spayed/neutered.

Eve is a stray roaming at my home. She has given birth at least once. I am not sure where she took her babies to but she comes back now and again. She is extremely weary and obsessively afraid of people and other aggressive cats. But she will meow you like crazy for food. I started feeding her and managed to catch her for spaying and was well taken care of 2 weeks after surgery. I released her after the stitches were taken out by the vet 2 weeks after surgery. As you can see now without having to get pregnant every 3 months and with daily feeding, she is very very healthy and has a pretty coat (even if she still roams as a stray). Can you imagine with proper care, she will be an absolute beauty!! So I am thinking with the right owner, I believe she can be rehabilitate to be a home pet. As I am allergic to cats, I can only feed her and not pet her or play with her. I hope to find her a loving and patient owner as I know she can learn not to be afraid of human touch. But you must be experienced cat owner and have the patient to deal with such cat. Of course, Eve is a special case and I must be updated on her progress constantly. Only suitable people should call. Do not SMS, whatsapp, I do not have time to reply. If you meet all the criteria above & below, then call us. 1. Must be experienced and a true cat lover 2. Able to provide safe home, food & medical care 3. No caging but must be kept in-house (room) as she is used to straying 4. Must update us 5.

Apparently, this incredibly friendly adorable sweet boy was abandoned by his heartless previous owner. Unfortunately, some residents are complaining about his presence and threatening to call dog catchers as we already have two resident strays on the premises. He is young (7-8 months?) and healthy (about 17kg as at 12 Apr ), and amazingly great with any humans and dogs. While he generally seems pretty gentle and obedient, being a teenager, he has boundless energy and loves to play with other dogs (and humans), and he is most likely to grow quite big at maturity. So we hope that he is adopted by an active family who can engage him in various activities and/or a family who currently has a relatively young active dog(s) who longs for a playmate/companion.

He would find shelter under cars and very few people fed him, which was why he was thin & hungry all the time. He kept trying to follow people home but no one would let him in.

He's been Frontlined for ticks & fleas and also de-wormed. Vet says he's a healthy boy at 8kg and most likely will grow up to be medium-large around kg. Mocha is possibly a mix of Belgian or German shepherd - based on his face and also the blue spots on his tongue. However, his body and fur is that of a terrier. Mocha is a very smart dog. He doesn't dirty the house and prefers to poo & pee at grassy patches. He will keep jumping or looking at the gate if he needs to go. He doesn't bark unnecessarily, only when it's really important. In fact, he managed to foil an attempted house break-in by barking very loudly when someone tried to enter the fosterer's opposite neighbour's house. He also gets along with his fosterer's male dog and is friendly to humans too. Mocha is more suitable for houses, preferably with a grassy patch for toileting. As he is still a puppy, adopters must understand that he will go through a chewing phase as his puppy teeth changes to adult teeth. Hence adopters should buy rawhides and chew toys. Adoption fee of RM50 is to cover vet bills, food as well as a donation to an animal shelter. Adopters must also sign an adoption form and agree to follow-up home visits, if necessary.

I've observed Happy to be an easy dog to care for. She is trained to do her toileting on grass, but adopters can also train her to do on newspapers. Happy is medium-size and approximately 18kg.

He's extremely friendly with everyone, including the doctor (although he didn't really like getting his temperature taken). He's gotten his first vaccination shot but will have to wait a bit before getting neutered. Charlie is quite easy to handle in the bath and comes out looking like a funny kitty version of Dobby the House Elf. He has a bit of a Donald Duck sort of voice which is quite unique. He's quite proud that his voice sounds like a famous cartoon character. He does well with small dogs (he really likes following his big sister around) and he will follow any human who comes into view and catches his attention. He's curious about bigger dogs but he doesn't enjoy being lunged at by excitable ones. He's a very laid back fellow who's fine with other cats as long as they're fine with him. Charlie can't quite decide what he wants to be when he grows up. He loves playing football and he loves adventuring like Indiana Jones and exploring new nooks and crannies. He also likes climbing and perching on high spots like a ninja monkey. Ideally, he would love to be a professional football-playing-ninja-monkey-adventurer cat when he grows up.

The students from my college called me on Sunday morning to help rescue the dog about a year old doggie, his name is Potato (Cantonese). My students said that the dog is very good natured, very playful and protective of the girls, they took care of him since he was a pup where they hid him from the MPPP that shot and killed Potato’s mum. My students told me someone beat up and threw bleached at him and his eyes were all inflamed before CNY. Before that, there have been incidents where someone tied a plastic bag over his head and people threw hot water at him. And the worse was on Saturday night, they found Potato tied up with a snooze made from fishing line, thrown into the big garbage bin but some auntie came and told the students about the incident and my students climbed into the bin to save him. Because of lack of blood circulation from the snooze, his paws were all swollen and his neck too. He was very lucky my students saved him in time and they took care of him the whole night. I cannot imagine how evil some people can be! Monsters!!!!! I just can’t stop crying to think that this doggie was so badly treated by those ‘animals’ Potato deserves a better life than being tortured… My students can’t keep Potato because they are only renting rooms and the landlady was so mad, she threatened to call the M.P.P.P to come kill Potato on Monday. My students couldn’t stop crying because they will have to go back to their hometowns for the semester break and were afraid that the landlady will hurt Potato so they have asked me to help, I took Potato home. However the house that I've placed the puppies at, my friend’s parents found out and my friend backed out on loaning out his compound (eventhough it’s vacant!) and I have no place to house Potato by end of next week. Fortunately my cousin said he could put Potato in a cage in one of the store rooms but only for like max early next month. Taking him to S.P.C.A is not an option because after what he has been through, I would never take him there and I’m hoping someone good can adopt him. Potato is a wonderful dog, I’ve played with him these few days, we go for walks (I have to tie all my other dogs up, they are very aggressive towards him) and Potato is so loving, at first he was weary but then now he seems better and more willing to trust me and I can’t stop crying on how cruel and evil people can be to treat a sweet dog like him that way… We would give him all the immunity shots by next week at the vet because he had maggots on him from wounds and my vet gave him vitamin, calcium and antibiotic shots on Monday. I hope if you could help please please try to find someone to adopt Potato? I really hope he could find a loving owner because he deserves that after all that he has been through. I really would like to keep him but because I have so many dogs, they don’t respond well to another male dog and knowing Potato’s past, I know I can’t possibly give him a good loving home by being overwhelmed and I’m afraid that he will be badly bullied by my dogs here. I’m just so tired with human nature and their mentality of hurting innocent animals such as Potato.""

Please understand that you will be asked plenty of questions before confirmation. Thanks for your patience and time in advance. ATTENTION ADOPTERS (IMPORTANT) **Conditions** - Prefer working adults to support food, medical expenses and other necessities. - If possible, a home with an existing senior cat (that is also SPAYED/NEUTERED) - Please ask permission from the people around you and receive their consent before adopting. - Kitten will be personally sent to your home if conditions allow. Adopters are REQUIRED to update progress as often as possible especially during the first few months. You will also be given probation to see if they fit your personality. If not, kindly call and return the kitten to us. - Proactive adopters will be given priority, meaning, good-hearted ones that provides as much information to all the questions asked. I will need to personally speak to you via phone/in person. **** Please provide details about yourself such as; Name, Age, Work Status (working/studying, local/international), hometown, experiences with pet (if none, research and explain), your house type, family members, your reasons to adopt (MOST IMPORTANT), your knowledge to care for kittens. - Reminder that there is an adoption fee of RM80 to cover some of her expenses. - Interested adopters should atleast have cage and litter pan ready for her. Will explain reasons if interested. - Kitten is currently too young for any vaccinations or procedures, therefore she must be contained from other cats. Vaccination is required to prevent any disease or infection. First, it will be done monthly and then ANNUALLY. Spaying is also a MUST to prevent any further unwanted litters when she reaches 5 months old. Deworming is also just as important. As of now, she has been dewormed on 13 July . Remember, adopting is a commitment. Pets are not substitutes and will never be for they are all equal and different beings, bearing their very own unique personalities. Do not adopt if you are expecting them to replace someone or an old pet. Kittens will grow up, make messes and trouble, you will need to be willing to sacrifice time, energy and support her financially throughout her life for the next 15 YEARS. They will, however, return our love and care equally and with so many more extras.

So, he was dewormed and also given an advocate treatment for the mange. Now his fur is growing back and he is gaining weight! That's good news! :-) He now acts like a normal kitten, jumping on anything that moves including my dog! He seems to be fearless! Nothing seems to scare him.

Hence, the name Yat Yat (meaning 'one one' in Cantonese). Based on the dog's condition when it was found, it was believed to have been abandoned by its heartless owner. The dog suffered from a severe inflammation of the ear where the ear canals are almost completely closed. It also has mange. This obviously neglected dog was sent to the vet for treatment and is currently under the care of my uncle. However, my uncle is only willing to foster it for about a month. Therefore, if I am not able to find an adopter before the deadline, I would have to put this poor dog to sleep. This is the last thing that I want to do as this dog is really well-behaved, very friendly and seemed so innocent, not knowing what its future would be. Yat yat is also partially blind due to cataract. Despite this, he still looks very happy with its life, wagging its tail whenever he hears someone (anyone) nearby although he cannot see. He would also reach his hand out and try to touch us although it doesn't know exactly where we are. I hope that a true animal lover who is willing to care for this dog with all his/her heart would adopt this lovely dog. Yat Yat had suffered enough to have fall into the hands of such owner. Hopefully, its next owner would be a much better one. If you think you are that person, kindly contact me asap! Thank u! ** Yat Yat would be passed to the new owner once it has fully recovered from the otitis (inflammation of the ear) and mange. Here are some details about Yat Yat after I got to know him:- LIKES - a small little house with cozy blanket (so my uncle made him a little house with a cardboard box.

It looked extremely famished so i gave it something to eat. After eating i saw the kitten trying to run or escape so i just allowed it, thinking that it wasn't comfortable with my 5 other cats breathing down her neck. Later that morning just as i'm about to leave for work it crawled up my car AGAIN but this time i couldn't see it. she was so deep inside the exhaust we had to get a mechanic's help. After awhile, we got her out but she ran AGAIN! but this time she went straight into the deep drain. My father decided to just leave her there and made me go to work without taking her out. Later my sister came back and heard her meowing and went straight into the dirty drain and saved its life :) now..its stuck with us ahahah. I already have 5 cats and i cant take anymore so someone please adopt this little precious, before raya. i'll be going overseas for raya and boarding 5 cats will already be a hassle 1 more will be worst. So someone pleaseee help me :D Updated 21/8/ This afternoon my father thought it would be good to let her out of her cage to play around. She went to my neighbour's house and suddenly we couldn't find her anymore :( but i just hope she'll be alright. i've done what i can all i can do now is hope for the best :) Updated 22/8/ Hmm found her again this morning lololol so waiting for adoption yet again!!!!",be1f988f9,3.0,7.4,7.4,0.0,0.0,6.5,6.5,-0.5000000000000002,-0.5000000000000002,0.9435587372222223,2.830676211666667,0.08663096886666666,0.2598929066,0.07235229505666667,0.21705688517000002,0.79999995,2.39999985,1.0,3.0,cat small to medium sized cats whiskers cat small to medium sized cats,kitten hope car sister front father something cats cats neck help someone drain work time work drain exhaust mechanic meowing life ahahah cage house neighbour someone best adoption lololol more Hmm,2,Domestic Medium Hair,,

They have been taken to the vet and the vet prescribed a fungal cream and shampoo. Ginger's fur will grow back again once he feels safe and secure. Whitey's fungal infection will get better with the fungal treatment. They are very loving and litter trained. Please adopt them together as Ginger might be stressful without Whitey. Ginger dan Whitey dijumpai di warung pada bulan August yang lalu. Adik beradik ini telah di adopt lebih kurang 2 1/2 bulan yang lalu.

Mereka berdua tidak dijaga dengan elok kerana bulu Ginger sekarang gugur kerana stress dan Whitey pula belakangnya ada fungal. Mereka telah dibawa ke vet dan telah mendapat rawatan dengan krim dan shampoo. Bulu Ginger akan tumbuh semula bila dia rasa stabil dan selamat.

He still remember to pee on newspaper even though d adopter let him pee & poo all over their car porch. Overall he is very hyper, wearing d ecollar & banging everything along d way. He doesn't know d basic command like Sit ! I will have alot of works to train him ! If u r looking for a pet to spent time with, consider Bosch, gv him ur time n efforts, he will gv u his life of loyalty & love. day 2. Noticed that he barks really Loud ! He can be tie to a chain but if u leave him, he will starts barking. A bit of improvement today, he will sit as I commanded him to before I release him fr the chain. Day 3. He doesn't want to eat his kibbles, keep disturbing me while i serving my home cook meal to my dogs. I just didnt gv in and after an hr, he finally ate all d kibbles. Only after that i gv him d home cook meal. Day 4. Will sit immediately when i command him to. At one point during d day, I tie him up coz I need to in & out fr d back door (if not he will run out), not long after being tied, he felt asleep ! That trigger me d thought of maybe previous adopter used to tie him up long hours, so he got used to sleeping with d chain on ! Haaai ...... Poor boy. Day 5 to day 8. Now he will finished d kibbles fast n then wait for rice, he got it. I carried him like a baby this afternoon, hint legs rest on d side of my waist, he likes it. I can understand y he always barks when I hv to leave him, maybe he wants accompany, he has separation anxiety 😅 I lost count of d days 😝. Anyway, he loves to take a bath, not afraid of water at all. I used just 1 day to train him to go into d cage willing (by using a treat to lured him), not bad at all, smart boy. Whenever I need to wash d floor, I'll put him in d cage n he will quietly stay in there, sometimes fall asleep in there while waiting for me to finish up washing. He feel secure to sleep in d cage.

Anyway, he was adopted last December but returned to me just 2 days ago (11.3.) because the adopter said he is naughty and not obedient.

Both of them are sisters, very playful, sweet looking and well mannered cats. The reason I am putting for adoption because we are moving out from our current house soon. I am afraid after we left, these two cats will not have a proper shelter and foods. Unfortunately I do not have any latest photos of the 2 cats, below is the description: 1st cat– 1 year old- medium size, love to play and be pampered, has beautiful big black eye and coated with white, black and oranges patches. 2nd cat- blue eyes, short tail, very playful, coated with orange and white patches, little scared of stranger due to constantly bullied by small boys around our housing area. Both the cats are very close to each other after the mother left them, so I would prefer both cats are adopted together rather than separately as it may upset their feeling. These two cats need lots of attention, responsible and caring family to care for them. They can be great companion for you. Vaccinations and neutering/spaying are compulsory for adoption. If you are interested to view the kittens, please call me at (Teluk Kumbar, Penang),only genuine adopters.

She is the mummy of the other 5 adopted kittens. She tried all the time that she is allowed to stay with us. She was very quiet (unlike now she likes talking sometimes) and behave carefully, never come to the kitchen. She is the cleverest cat so far I know. Guai Guai learns the rules very quick. If you do not want her to do so, you just need loudly shout her with no. After one or two times, she knows already. And she was once a stray cat, she never learned to be armed, or laid down on your legs as a baby. Generally she does not like it. After half year training, now before I go to sleep, she usually comes to me and lies down on my belly under the quite for a while. She is also very tolerant, even something she does not like, she still allow you to do without running away or scratch you. She loves to be touched very much. When I get up, she is just rolling around me and I must stroke her. We will move abroad. It will be cold there and we need travel a lot due to new situation. We think it is better for Guai Guai if she stays in Malaysia. She is very shy. And she cannot stay with the other cats (unless the kittens are younger than 1 month). Please keep her indoor before she get familiar with you. And please be a little bit patient because she is shy. And please do not hit her, because she can learn the things so or so, but she has a good memory, so she will never forget. She likes every tasty solid food, but ‘royal canin’ is not suitable for her. She likes fresh chicken chest, but not wet chicken food or cooked chicken. She loves wet fish food, but dry fish snacks is not her favorite. She likes play catch & go, hide & find. She likes simple toys and balls. She does not like mouse toy.

My parents sealed off the hole, without realising that the kittens were still inside. When we finally brought them out, the mother cat took two of the kittens, but left one behind. I took the little kitten, and gave it to my friend for temporary shelter while we try and find her an owner. Sadly, I could not find anyone who would take her in. However, as she was happy with my friend and his family, finding a family wasn't too much of a priority in my life. Especially with my university and visa applications, I eventually stopped asking for anyone. My friend and I had also decided that if we could not find her an owner by February, we would send her to the SPCA. Unfortunately, Hanabi got into an accident a few days ago. Either she fell down really hard, or she got hit by a passing vehicle. Whatever the cause, she had temporarily lost control of her bowel movements, and her tail is dislocated. It will take us 2 weeks to see whether she can regain control of her bowel movements, but other than that she can walk, eat, jump, and still be the friendly kitten she is. Now, with these handicaps, even if my friend and I were to take her to the SPCA, the chances of her living past one week are near 0. I have heard that if a pet is not adopted within one week's time at a certain animal shelter, they put the pet to sleep to make room for others. People who do not know what a lovable kitten Hanabi is will not even think of adopting her. She is facing a loveless life at the Animal Shelter, or she is facing a death penalty in a couple of week's time. And my friend and I only have two weeks left as a deadline. We have both tried Facebook and emails, but so far the only things we have found are pity and sympathy, which doesn't help us solve Hanabi's problem. Therefore, I am appealing to all of you. If you are interested in giving poor Hanabi a home, or if you know of anyone who might be interested, please let me know. Ask around, ask your parents friends, ask your friend's friends. Hanabi has been vaccinated, but she had yet to be spayed. Her medical bill is paid by my friend and I. She is very lovable, and very active. She has also been potty trained, and recently she has shown to have regained control of her bowel movements. She is having trouble walking because of the fracture on her leg, but she is healing and should be alright. Hanabi is a grey kitten, and is female. She is big sized, but only because my friend may have been over feeding her. She loves being petted and hugged, and is extremely friendly, even to other animals. Her name has two meanings, one is ""Flower Petal"", because I temporarily housed her in a flower pot while finding a cage, and ""Fireworks"", which also suits her, seeing as she enjoys pouncing and jumping at people a lot.",e88e25bc4,3.0,11.5,11.5,0.0,0.0,10.2,10.2,1.5999999999999996,1.5999999999999996,0.9191625455555555,2.7574876366666667,0.08505835496666668,0.2551750649,0.06298126890000001,0.18894380670000002,0.79999995,2.39999985,1.0,3.0,mammal room window covering property cat mammal small to medium sized cats,friend kitten anyone family hole family cats space house bowel movements owner kittens Hanabi two shelter hole parents mother cat kittens owner family kitten anyone life much People priority visa applications university Fireworks kitten kitten pity animal shelter control control anyone pet pet life SPCA handicaps others accident vehicle tail cause chances couple death penalty deadline emails things control room cage bill leg fracture trouble Animal Shelter animals name people friend friends friends Facebook lot meanings flower pot Flower Petal parents problem sympathy all home,2,Domestic Short Hair,,

I'm looking for fosterer/ adopter for him as I am working and no time to look after. Yesterday, my cousin found a stray dog behind her office who was crying in pain. She found out that he was unable to move and quickly send him to the vet. After all the x-rays, clearly it has suffered a broken backbone, most likely due to the impact from a hit and run event as it's quite severe. This caused him to be partially paralyzed. The vet has tried his best and advised her to consider putting it to sleep. She came to me and asked me to help her out and see if anyone would be willing to take him in and care for him. Both of us are unable to adopt him as we are both working and have hectic schedules. I am in the IT and the nature of my work is extremely hectic. Hence I am sure I will not have the time to take good care of him. We love dogs, and we refuse to put it to sleep at the time being at least until Monday. We have been contributing to its x-rays, medication, staying costs and etc. Putting him to sleep is the very last resort and we really do not wish for that to happen. We are doing the very best we can to save his life, we really wish we can. Please help...

It's really a bad time because I'm leaving to the Netherlands on 9th August, but hey, I can't leave her there when there's stray dogs running around. So it's been 3 weeks she's staying at my place and she's learnt how to use the litter box. I'd very much like her to find a loving family to continue to provide her with affection and care. She's very playful and her favourite toy is a wine cork tied to a string. After a long day's playing she'll fall asleep on your lap while you're watching TV or reading emails. Stroking her hair can be very relaxing and therapeutic after a long day. She'll open her eyes occasionally to check if everything's alright and fall asleep again. After Meow is fully recharged with adequate sleep and yummy in her belly, she can run around the house at the speed of light to prove herself worthy of another playing session. Before you know it, you'll be in love with this hairy this creature. She has been dewormed and got her first vaccination.

Once we got to know Harry better, we gave him shelter and fed him as well. We found him to be a great guard dog whenever he is in the compound. Harry is docile and obedient, yet alert and watchful for strangers. He roams freely around the house's outer compound and does not make a mess. Harry loves to be around kids and the neighbours are friendly with him. He enjoys walks with the children and running with us when we go for our jogs. Due to his close proximity with us in the neighborhood, we got Harry vaccinated, neutered and dewormed. He is also regularly bathed and checked for fleas. The neighbour's kids would regularly clip his nails/claws and play with him. Harry takes dog biscuits and real meaty treats. Our neighbors are mostly with dogs or cats, a mix of different races and all with irregular working times. As we are worried for his well-being and safety, we have all agreed that Harry deserves a permanent home and a family who can care for him full time. We believe that Harry will make a great family dog and companion to his future owner. He would love an adopter with sufficient space to move around, someone to take him for walks and the occasional tummy rubs when possible. For those who would like to adopt Harry, do visit my profile and contact me through it. We will provide you with his harness, collar and leash for no extra charge :)",6f5c2fe62,4.0,9.2,9.2,0.4,0.4,8.600000000000001,8.600000000000001,6.999999999999999,6.999999999999999,0.9042674941666666,3.6170699766666665,0.09003418068071428,0.3601367227228571,0.0708563079957143,0.2834252319828572,0.79999995,3.1999998,1.0,4.0,dog dog breed black and white vertebrate dog dog like mammal dog dog breed dog breed group dog breed,Harry neighbours neighborhood care breed Chinese New Year compound neighborhood shelter neighbour strangers neighbours neighbors compound kids dog biscuits kids all jogs proximity fleas house children claws nails treats cats mix races dogs companion mess owner space someone walks tummy rubs family dog profile family charge leash collar harness working times home safety well-being,1,Mixed Breed,,

Which sucks because if there was ever a cat to convert a dog person this would be the cat. I don't think she's too old, maybe 2 or 3 years at most. Extremely, extremely loving cat. She loves people and will follow you around like a dog. Her favorite thing ever is for you to pick her up like a baby and rub her tummy. Seriously. I included a photo of the position she drops to immediately if she thinks there's a chance for a belly rub. Does not bite or claw people. I have stepped on her tail before and she did not even make to bite or claw, merely meowed and moved away. She's on the small side for a cat and has really blue gorgeous eyes. Doesn't like sitting still for photos though. Clearly does not have the makings of an Internet celebrity cat, despite her good looks. Warning : if you do not manja her she will definitely demonstrate her Siamese yowling / meowing complaints. Would really prefer to home her as an indoor cat with an owner who is home a lot. Not sure how she is with other cats but she definitely is not a dog fan (she ran into my -a stranger's arms, when about to birth because there were stray dogs up the road).

We have too many cats in our small place, and we are running out of hands and money to take care of them. We've been wanting to get Maya to be neutered but she always end up pregnant first as she spends most of her time outdoors. We don't have the heart to keep her locked up in a cage. Anyway, we absolutely insist that the whole family is adopted. If we wait until the kittens are old enough to be weaned Maya would get pregnant again by that time. Please take them only if you do have the space for the whole family. The kittens are still very young, and I'm not sure if it's ok to bring them to a new house this early. You can reserve them and we can arrange the transfer a few weeks from now. The kittens are very pretty, one of them has a 'batik' pattern. Two are tri-colored, which I'm pretty sure means they're female. I'm available by phone only until Aug 18th. After that please contact my brother Nasir at. We can provide transportation too if you are in Selangor + KL area. Just let us know so that we can arrange it.

I'm seeking for urgent help to re-home Bobby, someone who is kind to provide him a loving environment.

He is eating good but he still need time to regain his weight. He is very tame, active and eager for care and love. With all blessing, I sincerely hope someone can help Bobby by adopting him.

She also emits small mews when she wants you to look at her and has a unique marking ( fur color ) like a mole on her upper left lip. Her entire fur coat is also of very unique Calico colors ( White , Cream & Chocolate ). She's also very very easy to look after. Spends most of her time looking out at the world from my balcony and loves to sleep and cuddle. -------------------------------------------------------------- Si Cookie amat ramah and ceria tapi dia segan dan sangat manja. Sesuai untuk keluarga atau individu yang mencari seekor kucing sebagai teman. Sebab dia segan, ia akan mengambil sedikit masa untuk Si Cookie mengenal anda. Akan tetapi bila dia sudah rapat dengan anda, Si Cookie suke ikut bersama and mendampingi sesiapa yang berada di rumah. Cookie suka bermain dengan bola kertas dan cebisan kertas. Gelagat dia lucu biler bermain :). Warna bulu Si Cookie agak jarang ditemui di kalangan breed Calico sebab warnanya putih, cream & coklat. Breed Calico yang biasa selalunya berwarna, oren, putih dan hitam. Hobi Cookie adalah duduk dekat balkoni tengok burung dan tidur siang.",5c5189b56,9.0,,,,,,,,,0.9315648377777779,8.38408354,0.07956013293222224,0.7160411963900001,0.06444304733333334,0.5799874260000001,0.79999995,7.19999955,0.9988888833333333,8.98999995,cat small to medium sized cats cat like mammal cat small to medium sized cats christmas decoration,,2,Domestic Short Hair,2.0,Calico

She is very affectionate with people, though she usually doesn't sit still long enough to get petted. She loves to be around her people and talks until her people give her the attention she deserves. Fendi in our care have received: Shots, flea treatment, deworming, veterinary exam (very healthy), and FIV & FLV test done. Fendi is even looks bigger than a picture. To ensure the health and proper care, Fendi has been provided under private vet and nurses care for almost two months.

My father offered to foster and eventually adopted her into his pack. Ruby's profile can be viewed here - ). Along with my dad’s dogs, I personally have a one-year puppy myself - Daisy Mae, making it a total of 4 dogs, and 12 cats I have under my care. We've been rescuing strays for as long as we can remember, and somehow, we've always found room for one more. My temporary solution in attempt to keep the family together was to continue to pay rent for my dad’s place so that his dogs would still have a home. Rental alone, not inclusive food and necessities for the dogs cost RM1, a month. On an average, with food and necessities, it probably easily sums up to RM/RM, and sometimes RM a month. While I’ve always believed that money can always be earned again, it’s also a hefty sum to cough out on a monthly basis for 3 dogs alone. My dad’s landlord is also keen on taking back the house, and have it rented out to new tenants. With that said, the clock is ticking for me. I have only until the end of February to look for new homes, or a solution for Gigi, Bobby, and Ruby. What I ideally want is to have these dogs under my care, because they were my dad’s babies. He loved them to bits. His whole life was about them - he took care of them exactly like his own children. When he saw that I was cooking for my pets, he did the same - he would cook for them and when he couldn’t, he would lavishly treat them to packets of chicken rice, fruits, and all sorts. Sometimes, their meals are even more lavish than his own. Gigi was his little princess. She was the first of the pack, adopted at about 6 months old. Everywhere my dad went, Gigi was right behind him. She’s very loyal and protective. Every night without fail, she would take her spot right beside my dad on his bed - sleeping only when he sleeps. She would occasionally try to steal kisses and belly rubs from my dad before bedtime. If my dad pretends to be asleep, she would nudge him repeatedly until he finally gives in, and gives her the belly rubs she wanted. Gigi is also very demanding in her own little adorable ways - she wouldn’t let my dad stay past his bedtime, and if my dad had visitors around, she would bark to remind him that bedtime was near. She wouldn’t take no for an answer. If he ignores her, she would continue to bug him until he gives up and goes to bed. Bobby is just a gentle old-soul. He had a family prior to this, and he lost his way one day. By fate, he ended up in front of my dad’s house. In the beginning, my dad didn’t want to take Bobby in, but because Bobby never left (he wandered the streets but every night, he would faithfully return to my dad’s house and slept right outside the gate) my dad eventually decided to adopt him two weeks later. We then found out that Bobby was fearful of many things, especially when you hold up certain objects in front of him - he would retreat with his head hung low, somewhat afraid that he might be hit. We suspected that he had been abused before. But my dad believed that there was nothing love and patience cannot cure, and he was right. In time, Bobby grew accustomed to him and trusted him (and Gigi) as his family. My dad’s life changed tremendously with the presence of Gigi and Bobby. Life was simple, but it was just so cheerful and so full of love. We’ve never been rich, and on some days, we had little to spare, but my dad had his ways, and he made sure that his fur kids were well taken care off. During the last few months of my dad’s life, he was in and out of the hospital for quite a bit, and each time he got admitted, the first thing he would do is to remind me to take good care of his children - to make sure that they are well fed, and are okay at home. Even as he was hooked up on all sorts of machines, he would think about them and about their well being, despite all the pain and discomfort he experienced. As I’m writing this right now, I feel so incredibly guilty and helpless for not being able to protect and preserve the most important ‘people’ in my dad’s life. But at the same time, I’m aware that realistically, I’m not able to make drastic changes in my life and get a bigger space that can accommodate 4 dogs under one roof. Presently, the space that I have just isn’t big enough to have everyone together, and I do not have animal-loving people as neighbours (which makes things even more difficult). So here I am, humbly seeking for your kindness and understanding, to know how much this means to me, and how important it is that I find good homes for my father’s dogs because I am unable to take care of them myself. I’m opened to trial adoptions, temporary fosterings - anything that can help in helping me find a new family for these loving fur kids. If you know of anyone who is interested/can help, I'd appreciate if you could please help spread the word. Thank you. *Gigi (female), Bobby (male), and Ruby (female) are spayed/neutered. *They are flexible as indoor and outdoor dogs. *We're not too sure of Gigi and Bobby's age - but as a rough estimate, they are about 6 - 8 years old.

I found little Olly behind my office with a broken leg (from an accident) covered with motor oil (hence the name) and mud. Although he didn’t resist me and sat quietly while I drove, I knew this little fellow was a fighter. After he had rested for a week (under the covers) only coming out to eat, his true spirit came out. This little fellow doesn’t give up. Despite his broken leg, he wanted to run around the house. Now all mended, he has turned out to be one of the most handsome kittens I have seen. A perfect combination of white and orange, he has beautiful orange fur on the top whilst his face down to this paws are white. Due to his accident he cant mew very much or very loud, but he makes up by rolling around your feet and head butting you all day. This little champ needs someone who can love him unconditionally as he has been through so much in his short life. He also needs a friend as he loves to play and ends up inviting you for a game all day. I would prefer my cats are kept as indoor cats with space to run around as they love to play. I am very strict about not caging my fur kids and hope you don’t cage them. Imprisoning them in a small cage is inhumane. Cats are curious animals who love to explore their surroundings. Give them space to walk and run around. I have given him his first vaccinations and expect their new parents to follow through with yearly vaccinations. Taking care of fur kids is easy. All they need is some food, lots of love & attention and they will be at your side all their life. Lastly it would be great if he has another partner to play with at home.

Ash`colours are lovely. Starts with a lovely white face and ends at his perfect long ringed brown raccoon tail. He is very playful and loving. First one to greet u at the door. He loves food. Games and his spot on the chair. Ashton has not been spayed due to his age. Spaying by the new family is compulsory at 6 months. Please consider adopting ash together with his friend blu as they are close friends and it is great entertainment to watch them play. Conditions: Indoor cats: I would prefer my cats are kept as indoor cats with space to run around and play. I am very strict about not caging my fur kids and hope you don’t cage them (unless required by vet). Cats are curious animals and are constantly exploring their surroundings. Give them space to walk and run around. But also remember to kitty proof your house. Good Quality Food: My cats are fed some sort of premium brands. Good quality food is important to maintain their health and more beneficial for you in the long run (less vet visits!) Companions: Cats are very social animals and it is healthier to adopt two so they can have another cat to play or interact with. Especially if you are busy at work or otherwise most of the day :). But if you can only get one cat, then please consider adopting an adult cat. Adult cats are usually litter box trained, spayed and easier to take care. Their personality is developed and you know what you get. They are also more independent and mellow in their games and spend a lot of time napping ;). Medical/vets: My cats are not spayed/neutered if less than 6 months. You must agree to do so at 6 months. You must also agree to give booster shots (if required) and yearly veterinary examination. Other Conditions: You will need to fill an adoption form when you adopt my cats. If you ever feel you can’t cope with them, they have to be returned to me. I love to receive updates on their progress with pictures. If you are travelling, i would like first right of refusal for taking care of them when you are away (depending on my schedule). Taking care of fur kids is easy. All they need is some food, lots of love & attention and they will be at your side all their life. But before adopting, please consider your financial situation.

She was born on 11 Jan and got her name from the unique patches on her fur that makes her look different everyday. You will never get bored watching this little one play. Sometimes she looks gold sometimes brown and sometimes gold& black. She is a fluffy cat with the softest fur. Although timid, she is also very gentle and friendly. She is a perfect lap cat cuddling on your lap for a nap and running to greet you after a long day. An interesting fact about tortoiseshell cats is In the folklore of many cultures, cats of the tortoiseshell coloration are believed to bring good luck.Dating back to Celtic times, tortoiseshell cats have been perceived to bring good fortune into their homes. Even today, the Irish and Scottish believe stray tortoiseshell cats bring them luck. In the United States, tortoiseshells are sometimes referred to as money cats.

When I first saw her, I couldn't believe my eyes to see this tiny angel jalan jalan on the road looking for food. She was so tiny to be recognized as a cat at first sight. I asked around the guards who are there on the street at all the times, he said she was there alone woundering around for 2 days. She is really a small angel and lovely character. Suprisingly, she wasn't afraid of people at all and even approched us for help. I took her to my house to give her food and shelter. It's really a shame that I can't keep this angel since I am expecting soon and having already 2 rescued cats at home now. So I really want to find her a good companion and loving home which she deserves so much. She is very bright and friendly character. She loves people!! Very healthy and able to use her liter box perfectly already. We did first deworming and her 2nd deworming and Vaccination will be 10 days from now. Condition for adopting Tiger: 1. About the adoption fee Rm, I have to know the person who is interested in Tiger will give her good life and support. You are very welcomed to donate this amount to pet finder instead and just show me the proves. 2. She is so small that we hope the person who adopts her will keep her as indoor pet only. 3.

She has gone through few levels of training (Pre-Novice, Novice and Intermediate). She is a good indoor dog and never lives backyard or outdoor. She is microchipped and has a MKA certificate (but I lost the certificate). She could get along well with children but somehow will cause unintentionally injury to young kids (as bull terrier breed is active, it plays rough and has to be trained to be gentle) Hence, a family with young children is not suitable to keep her. Due to relocation on June , I can't bring her along with me. I truly hope a dog lover who could keep her well and allow me to follow-up from the time being. If you're interested, please contact me.

This poor furbaby had been through hell with a broken front right leg, two operations and three rods inserted. Now that our rescued Ubu has recovered, he is seeking for a forever home. Ubu is a sweet tempered and playful 1+ yo young dog. Despite his loving nature, he would serves as a good guard dog as he only barks at strangers or other dogs who come too close to the house gate. Otherwise, he barely makes a sound. Ubu is also very obedient and intelligent. He understand that he needs to go into the cage when fosterer drives out without being told or leashed. He is also toilet trained. He pees and poos only on grass but does not do so in house. So unless you have grassy compound, Ubu would need to be walked twice a day for nature calls. He is not aggressive and can be unleashed at parks as he will not attack other dogs, human/children. He would however show signs of resentment by growling if other dogs come too close. Most importantly, he is very friendly, safe and tolerant with rough toddlers. We hope you could give Ubu Wong Choy a chance to love and be loved. Kindly pm me or any of the tagged names if interested or at least click share to help this furbaby find a family.

He was registered in Batu Caves, but was found abandoned in Kepong. The second owner took him in and fostered him in Seri Kembangan until he had his newborn child, and he no longer could keep pets due to his child, so I took him in and cared for him, I wanted to make him mine. When I took him in, I was running my own business so I had the luxury and time to care for him and provided him the best place a dog could wish for - a big garden with other dogs to run round and play with. This big garden wasn't mine, but a good friend's garden. Unfortunately, one day he injured his eye, and his right eye is % blind. Things didn't go well for all of us last year, I lost my business, my good friend moved out and Peri now stays in a 2 X 6 feet laundry area in my unit. I work long hours at the office and after office hours to repay my debt that I accumulated. I appeal to the future owner of Peri to please care for him for the rest of his life. As I feel that I am imprisoning such a beautiful dog that all he wants is a belly rub and a lovely owner to play with him, which I cannot afford to provide currently. Peri's personalities. >Smart >Loyal >Obedient >Very very Manja (can sleep beside you the whole night or when you’re watching a movie giving him his belly rub without moving) He loves belly rubs! He can run around in circles before he jumps on the sofa, only to flip over and ask for a belly rub which I guarantee you cannot resist giving. He loves a shower and being groomed. Not spoilt when it comes to food either. I feed him doggie biscuits and he is absolutely fine with it. He is very quiet. He only howls when he hears the police siren, other than that, very friendly with other dogs but funnily afraid of cats! He knows how to sit, give paw, in(to go into his crate),come and leave it commands. When I adopted him, he already knew how to sit and, give paw when there is food. I thought him the leave it,in, come command in 3 X 15 mins sessions, that’s how smart he is. Very easy to train! He loves his walks. I walk him from time to time when I have time. Very easy to walk and won't go after other dogs and provocations. To the future owner, if you wish to adopt him, I really hope that this will be the last owner change for Peri. I thank you for reading my post and considering adopting this very lovable dog.

3212,2,5 DLH/Persian Breed Cats,36,264,0,3,1,2,6,2,3,2,2,2,2,5,100,41326,661825f462c5d7b4451f763f1827429e,0,"I'm opening this profile on behalf on my sis who is currently dealing with a serious medical condition which has left her financially unable and time poor to continue taking care of her cats that she's had for the past 3 years or so. Reluctantly she has decided to put 5 of her cats for adoption. They are all long hair cats. 2 of them are of Persian breed but with no cert, they're termed as DLH :) The following are details of the cats:- 1) Kiki Gender : Female Age : 2 years Size : Small Colour : Black/Brown Type : DLH-Persian peke faced breed Personality Kiki is tame and friendly. She needs extra care and attention as she is actually from Persian peke faced breed. Which means she's very flatfaced. Her eyes water a lot, needs daily wiping and since she's very flatfaced, she needs constant wiping around the eyes, mouth and nose area. 2) Bibi Gender : Male Age : 3 years Size : Medium Colour : Blue aka Gray Type : DLH-Persian flatface parentage Personality Bibi is friendly, will answer when called :) Very active and playful i.e will jump and prance around house. Not for the faint hearted. LOL 3) Chubaka Gender : Male Age : 3 years Size : Large Colour : Brown Tabby Type : DLH Personality Chubaka is similar to Bibi. Friendly and very playful. But he's large :P 4) Sylvester Gender : Female Age : 1 year Size : Medium Colour : Solid Blue Type : DLH Personality Sylvester is the offspring of Kiki and Bibi. Friendly. tame and likes being brushed. And my personal favorite...Don't ask me why she was named Sylvester! LOL! 4) Mocha Gender : Female Age : 1 year Size : Medium Colour : Brown Tabby Type : DLH Personality Mocha and Sylvester are from the same litter by Kiki. We believe they were sired by either Bibi or Chubaka or both :P Like Sylvester, Mocha is also friendly and tame. Note :- All of these cats are not in their optimum condition due to lack of time and financial ability to care of them. Almost all of them have minor fungus and loss of fur due to shedding, Mocha especially. She now looks like a lion i.e fur around the head but thinning on the body. They live in a big cage in the backyard since my sis' 2 yo daughter is allergic to fur. Our humid weather and lack of human attention which leads to stress could also be a contribution factor to their condition. Requirements Kiki, Bibi and Chubaka were both purchased at a price of between RM to 2.2K. Not that it makes them extra special vs any other cats, but it just means that we are seriously looking for people who love cats and are able to provide what my sis can't without selling them... 1) Adopter must have a household income therefore financially able to provide food and litter plus medical care. They're currently on Iams. So no less than that. Must use proper litter, no newspaper please. They're used to clumping clay based litter (i'm not sure of brand). They will need immediate medical attention for their fungus, possible earmites, vaccinations and deworming. Bibi and Kiki have had their kitten vaccinations but not adult. The others have not been vaccinated. 2) We would like for an adopter who already has at least one cat if adopting just one of them because they have all lived together all their lives so being alone will be stressful for them. Adopting more then one is welcomed provided adopter meets the requirements. However we would prefer a household with maximum 5 cats. These cats have not had enough human contact or free roam play time hence I'd like to ensure that adopters are able to give them a lot at attention and free space to roam. 3) Specifically for Kiki, we require an adopter who is experienced caring for a flatfaced Persian. 4) The adopter must ensure the cats receive a lot of attention which includes playtime and grooming (since they're DLH, daily brushing is best) and lots of love obviously :). 5) The cats must not be caged as they've been caged enough unless it is for their own safety and for a minimum amount of time. They must also be strictly kept indoors. 6) As mentioned, the cats are not in very good condition so immediate vet visit is a must and costs to be born by adopters. 7) Preference will be given to adopters who support neutering/spaying the cats to ensure the health of the cats and also to ensure they don't end up being commercialised or contribute to stray problems. 8). We would prefer adopters who are in Klang Valley and would appreciate if adopters are ok with ocassional visits by us. We will feel much better seeing the cats happy at their new homes and I'm sure my sis and hubby will miss these furkids when they leave... We require an adoption fee of RM to ensure that adopters are serious about the cats.

Appreciate someone could provide her a loving home to this poor doggie, she would make a lovely companion. She would also need a patient owner as she has some skin problem which I think could be solved by taking some supplement and good food.

She was probably little more than a year old, heavily pregnant, and living off scraps from a nearby hawker stall and goodies that people doing their shopping would buy for her. She wasn’t very keen to come home with us – she preferred to keep humans at a safe distance back then – but we managed to persuade her with some chicken pieces. She promptly vomited these up over me, my husband and the back seat of his company car on the drive home. A week later Laika gave birth to five beautiful puppies in a sunny corner of our home. She was still very wary of both me and my husband but she needed our help with her puppies and gradually started to trust us. She was a wonderful mother and was constantly looking after and looking out for her five energetic and demanding babies. With the help of the PAWS network in Miri we were able to find five good homes for the puppies, but Laika stayed on with us. This wasn’t a straightforward decision. We already had a dog and two cats and we thought carefully about the repsonsibility and cost of taking on another pet when we were certain our future would involve further travel and postings abroad in different countries. We didn’t know Laika’s background but her wariness around people and an injury on her front paw suggested she hadn’t had an easy start to life. But she had come to trust and depend on us and we had grown very attached to her. With her puppies rehomed and her mothering responsibilities over we got to know Laika better. She liked to go for walks and adapted quickly to walking in a harness and on a leash, but she loved being off the leash and running along the local beach, usually at quite amazing speeds. She loved being around us and would sit quite happily at our feet while we worked or watched TV or follow us around the house from room to room. She loved being stroked, especially on her tummy. You could fuss over her for hours and she wouldn’t get bored. And she loved food and was always a little worried about where the next meal was coming from or whether she could gobble up her dinner before someone else got to it. She got along well with our cats and, after a few disagreements over food, became friends with our other dog. She is still sometimes a little unnerved by sudden movements or excited squeals from our three year old daughter, but this has never caused us any significant concern. We also learned that she didn’t like loud noises or crowds and would pull out her harness if we came across a large group of children playing in the street. She became very nervous if people approached her on the street and it took time for visitors to the house to gain her trust. She was completely disinterested in playing ball or fetching sticks. She only chewed things when she was stressed or upset. After our first long holiday apart from her we came home to find an apologetic pet minder and the contents of the bottom row of our bookshelf in shreds on the rug. She’d demonstrated her displeasure at being left behind by chewing her way through half of the complete works of Charles Dickens. And we’d never got round to reading them first. We are heartbroken that we may lose Laika from our family. Although she is healthy and active, New Zealand Bio Security has denied her entry to the country because she has tested positive to having had Babesia Gibsoni (a variety of tic fever) at some time in her life. Even though the tests show she has fully recovered, the fact that she had it in her past, is enough to bar her from entry into NZ or Australia. We are having the tests repeated to ensure there was no mix up in the samples and are still hoping against hope that there may be some way around this problem, but are preparing ourselves for the worst. We would love to find Laika a loving home if we are unable to take her with us. She is a wonderful pet. She is loving and loyal and the perfect companion and will be your loving shadow when you are with her. As I write this she is curled up behind my chair and if I whisper her name I will receive an answering flick or two from her tail. Please help. I have never been more attached to a dog or more sure that she will bring huge joy to anyone who can offer her a loving home.

It was rainy season so we rescued them in fear that they might drown. The pictures shown were taken when they got their first vaccination at the vet. At the time, they were only 2.5 months old (verified by the vet). They may not seem like it because of their larger size, the vet believes they may be from a bigger breed. They are now 3 months old and I think it would be nice for them to have a new family that they can bond with from this early age. I have tried to get them neutered and spayed, but no vet would do it as they are too young. If you are looking for additional family members, please consider them. They are easily trained, very smart and listen well. Bear in mind though, they are still puppies. They like to play a lot but very manja at the same time. They must be adopted together. They know their names and will come when called. They know the commands ""sit"", ""down"" and ""off"". They play fetch the ball too! My conditions are: 1. Landed house with a patch of grass (for their toilet), with secured fencing so the puppies do not escape. They are not suitable for apartments. 2. Adopter has a chance for a trial period of 2 weeks. If the adopter feel the puppies are not a good match with their family, they can return after the trial period. At the same time, if I feel the adopter and puppies are not good match, I will have the right to reclaim them. This is to ensure both adopter and puppies will be happy in the long term, as this is a lifelong commitment. 3. Adopter must provide good food (they eat meatdust and sometimes kibbles) and water that is changed daily. 4. Adopter must provide a living space that is humane, not too hot and has shelter from the sun and rain. The dogs must not be caged and not tied up for long periods of time. 5. Adopter must promise to complete the 2nd and 3rd monthly vaccination (1st has been done by me) and then once yearly. If this happens during trial period, I will pick them up and get it done. 6. Confirmed adopter must promise to spay/neuter the puppies when they are 5 months old. If there is a problem, contact me and I will help you get this done and I will bear the cost. At this time, the puppies are cared for by a relative and so I apologize it is not possible to visit them. But I can bring them to you if you'd like to meet them.

She is very smart, I taught her how to fetch in only one day and she grasped it fast (as shown in video). She is dauschund-husky mix, very small build, but tall. Her owner was a neighbor who moved back to their homecountry, Korea. So I offered to take care of her till I can find her a new family. She is better suited for a family with landed property with a grass patch (she does her toilet business on grass), and with another young dog to play with. She can easily get lonely without another dog or person to play with, and sometimes her anxiety leads to not eating. She's a dog trainer's dream come true because she is very eager to learn and she does learn fast, with treats as motivator. If you are looking for a young dog who is matured enough and can easily be moulded through training from young, she is the one. Unfortunately I do not have the time to bring out the best in her. Choco is vaccinated, microchipped, spayed and dewormed and professional grooming. Adopter will be given her Pet Passport with her microchip serial number and medical details.

This is because I want to make sure the family and dog will match. If the trial period passes successfully, the adopter must allow me to visit (with prior appointment) a few times till both sides are happy.

I almost stepped on her on my way to a friend's place, and instead of running away, she actually came to me and allowed me to pet her! You could say she rescued herself! That was 2 weeks ago. I have never seen such a friendly kitten; she purrs like a motorboat on overdrive, loves being pet, meows for attention and would not hesitate to jump on your lap! In fact, she was purring away in my car and clambering over my lap/ chest for attention even before I reach home! She is dewormed, washed and given Frontline spray. She was a quite thin but has since put on some weight. She is also litter-trained (self trained... huhuhu). Every time I walk close to her she will meow her acknowledgement (or meow wanting to be pet... hehehe) While healthy, she hobbles along as there seems to be a problem with her left paw. The vet says she has probably suffered an accident which causes her to walk on her 'ankle'. But come play time, she will still bat and attack the mouse-on-a-string toy. I have too many cats to take care of another, though I can assure any new adopter that she doesn't seem to require any special attention. She can be active and jump onto my bed or sofa or explore the house. Please consider giving her a new home and she will love you back many times over.

Sorry to say that We are selective on the new owner thus its not for petshop or breeder! ------------ Some info on Ragdoll : History In the family of cat breeds, Ragdolls are among the younger siblings. The cats were first developed by breeder Ann Baker in Riverside, California, in the s. Baker’s foundation stock consisted of Josephine, a domestic longhair whose white coat concealed the genes for either a seal mitted or black tuxedo pattern, and various other longhaired cats of unknown ancestry that she owned or found in her neighborhood. Baker selected for cats with gentle, placid personalities, large size, and beautiful long coats characterized by a Himalayan pattern, the name for the “points” seen on Siamese-type cats. The result was a cat she called the Ragdoll, for its propensity to flop happily into the arms of anyone who picked it up. Later, Persians, Birmans and Burmese may also have contributed to the Ragdoll’s development. Baker made many unusual claims about the cats’ development, including alien influence, CIA experiments, and infusions of human genes, but that is all they are: claims, with no basis in fact. Other people had begun breeding Ragdolls as well. They broke away from Baker and formed the Ragdoll Fanciers Club International, with the goal of standardizing the breed and achieving recognition by cat registries. The Cat Fanciers Association began registering the cats in and gave them full recognition in . Most registries now recognize the breed, including the American Cat Fanciers Association and The International Cat Association. Ragdolls are not outcrossed to any other breeds.

Somebody, any cat rescuer out there please help this cat. I found him resting on my Kyon's cage last night. 1/2 of the face were covered in blood. Jaw might be dislocated. I need someone to help me, since my mom wont help me to help the cat. Im just a student right now who is powerless against her mother's veto power in the house. im begging you m(_ _)m brought him to AMC last night and was charged quite an amount of money. He got injection (antibiotic? vaccine? i dont know since its my pet brother who brought the cat to AMC). Vet said: - Normal wound on head. - Eyes is okay. - Need to leave the cat for boarding for abt 3 days before surgery. I seriously cant afford it. What should I do? Mom will let the cat go if I cant find anyone to help the cat soon. I have had enough fight on first Ramadhan with her since last night. So I'm begging you, anyone out there pleasee help this cat. I dont want my mother to let it go before it is treated but who am I to say that to her... m(_ _)m full detail/story: ----------UPDATE /------------ Salam, peopleee, GOOD NEWS \(^0^)/ *dances in circles* Orange survived! Surgery is a success! He made it! yayyyyy. ehem, ok Alhamdulillah. Sha baru call doctor. ape yg die cakap 1) orange is lookin good and very easy on himself. he meow when people come, resting in his cage lepak-lepak, eat pee n poo by himself. 2) the cost wouldnt be too much macam doctor expect since we didnt do the jaw surgery. it'll only be expensive if we keep him longer dekat sane. it is estimated to be around rm1k paling mahal pun 1.5k. gulp but better than RM 2k-3k kan? :) need to go to the clinic dulu then he'll discuss again about the total cost. now the problem: 1) orange is definitely tak biasa dengan org. so kena go slow dengan die, bagi die manje2 n trust orang. 2) so far, donation belum masuk dari mane2. so sha rasa kena somehow pinjam mana-mana dulu *thinks hard* 3) tak tahu lagi bila nak ambil Orange since next week I'll be so busy nak ulang alik pegi college and office I hope and pray that the potential adopter will accept Orange even for a little while, sementara nak bagi Orange fully recover. ----------MORE UPDATES /------------ and Dr.Teoh called me again just now, as for today, the total cost would be: RM++. but he tried omitting few charges and it became: RM, but he decided only RM! (but for today lah. the hospitalization will increase RM25 everyday) DOCTORRRRRRRRRRR THANKKK YOUUUUU. ----------- UPDATE ----------------- Orange was safely brought home today by his fosterer. We had another meet up at the vet. From what I have concluded: 1) For now Orange is still in a good condition: he eats (A LOT), his kidney is working well, the surgery sticthes have been removed and healed. 2) Dr.Teoh said, despite trying his best to bond with Orange, he found that Orange is a veryVERYY solitary cat. Cant blame him, doctor said he pity Orange.. since Orange is like very empty without any feeling. Might be because of his past/trauma, he's very terrified that he chose to isolate himself. He only meow when he wants food. 3) Orange might hiss hiss but he never bites. There was once where he attempts to bite the doc but due to the loss of his front teeth, no harm done, its not painful even by a BIT. XD;; 4) The wound however, will continue to spread and its getting bigger day by day. On the final stage, it'll spread to his lungs and that is when we'll need to PTS Orange :( (here still hoping there'll be some sort of miracle) [UPDATE ] YAYY new photo of Orange! So far Orange is stable. We can't do much for him since the wound are cancerous & incurable :( But we can still showers Orange with lots & lots of love & care & provide him comfort. Too bad we cant take out the collar since we're afraid that he'll scratch the wound and make it worse. ^^;; Be strong Orange! Live your life to the fullest, love. And we'll definitely continue to pray for you for sure! :)",9967c6cb6,12.0,16.8,16.8,0.0,0.0,14.699999999999998,14.699999999999998,4.9,4.9,0.9052087893939395,9.957296683333334,0.09004879524069502,1.0805855428883402,0.06897480352887038,0.8276976423464445,0.79999995,9.5999994,0.9883333291666666,11.859999949999999,dog like mammal dog mammal animal shelter cat text font paper text font animal shelter  dog breed group cat small to medium sized cats fauna cat small to medium sized cats whiskers animal shelter fauna gerbil cat animal shelter whiskers,cat rescuer tahu lagi bila nak ambil Orange Teoh UPDATE cat Im wound Surgery cat mom wont mother cat cost eyes cage Jaw mother blood face student veto power house money amount someone AMC cat anyone anyone pet brother cat cat orange cat PLEASEEEE Kyon wound wound orange Eyes surgery jaw surgery Mom macam doctor harm vaccine head people fight dulu cost UPDATES problem dulu mana-mana peopleee lepak-lepak cage college pun k. gulp clinic donation dengan detail circles dances call doctor pee ape yg poo story injection Vet office adopter charges lah hospitalization Ramadhan RM much feeling trauma food hiss BIT teeth loss doc stage lungs cat collar PTS Orange sort biasa dengan masuk dari mane2 Salam GOOD NEWS Alhamdulillah Sha baru lots lots love love fullest RM++ miracle photo showers care life XD doctor Orange comfort best vet fosterer home kidney LOT condition surgery sticthes THANKKK YOUUUUU Cant,2,Domestic Short Hair,,

The daddy or culprit is and pure breed boxer. Attached will be some pictures of the pup and their parents. There are 4 male pups and 3 female pups for adoption.

She is now urgently looking for a new home. She was a stray puppy few years ago around my neighbourhood here. Then, an old auntie adopted her. Unfortunately this old auntie is getting older & older, and she is not very well now. So, currently is unable to take good care of Lucy. I went to feed her once a while and noticed that her current living place is very dark at night, a lot of grass, and a lot of mosquitoes too.. She is a simple dog.. Just a piece of plain bread will make Lucy a Happy Furkid :) Hoping to find her a good new home.. Please help me to share around..

We suspect that she was a lost dog but there were no tags on her nor does she seem to be looking for her way home. She is quite timid at first, it takes a bit to get her to warm up to you, but she is a big sweetheart after you get to know each other. She is, however, very protective once she acknowledges you and is an extremely good guard dog, she has got a good strong bark and listens to commands relatively well. You can walk her off leash after she has gotten used to you and the surrounding (at guarded areas and only if the people in your area are fine with it). We were originally thinking of keeping her for ourselves but we've already got a handful from our current dog, so we wish to find her a happier home where she can run free in or out.

She is a sweet dog, great with children, undemanding and easy to maintain (she doesn't require grooming). She is an outdoor (yard) dog. She is trained to pee and poop only outside once a day on a walk. She isn't destructive. She's a great house ""alarm"" - very alert when strangers pass by, but has never bitten anyone (barks but doesn't advance to attack). Before her adoption in , she was an abused pup (abused by people and other dogs). She hides and is very timid when new people approach her. Therefore, it takes a few weeks for her to ""come out of her shell"" with new company, in a new environment. Once she becomes comfortable and trusts her new family, she is very friendly, playful and loving. Sadly, we need to put her up for adoption because we have moved into a condo which doesn't allow pets. Bailey has been a huge blessing to us as a family. She is great around young children (my youngest is 4 now, in total we have 4 kids under 11), she has never jumped on them or nipped them. They can touch her, pull her, grab her , hug her and stroke her without resistance. She has a very calm disposition. If your heart is big enough to accept and adopt an abused dog who just needs some extra patience and love in the beginning, you will be greatly rewarded by her doggy love and friendship! Currently, she is fed once a day, a bowl of kibble. When she lived with us, she was on a % RAW diet with no problems. As we have moved, we have brought Bailey to live with her original Fosterer.

At the moment a friend of mine is helping me cat-sit until i find a new owner. I rescued both of them when they were still frail little kittens and nursed them back to health. They both are now fully grown cat adults and with the heaviest of heart I need to let them go due to relocation. Both Grey and Pumpkin are very docile and not prone to any aggresive behaviours. They are friendly and loves attention. Both love affection once they are used to you. I would prefer to have them adopted as a pair as I worry they will get lonely or miss each other. Pumpkin is neutered however Grey is not due to financial constrictions faced while relocating. I can arrange for her to be spayed or you may also do it in your own clinic. Fee can be waived. I will also give their two large litter boxes as well as a medium sized carrier. Please be a true cat lover if you are considering them.
